# SMS/Email Spam Classification ( End to End Machine Learning Project )

In this project, we have made a machine learning model to predict whether an email/sms is spam or not. For this, we have used kaggle to collect data. We have done data cleaning, preprocessing and model building. For checking the performance of model, we have used precision score as the dataset is imbalanced.
